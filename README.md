# Dayble Calendar
A fast calendar for Obsidian that stores events as monthly JSON files directly inside your vault. Fully customizable with colors, effects, and animations.

Dayble Calendar is non-intrusive. Events never appear in daily notes, keeping your notes clean. You can attach Markdown links to events to quickly jump to related notes.

This plugin is based on a customizable calendar I originally built as a [website](https://kazi-aidah.github.io/Aidah-s-Calendar/), rebuilt to work directly inside Obsidian!


## Event Categories
Style a Category once using colors, effects and animations

and assign events with the Category Styling right from the Add Event Modal!

or even assign triggers, what text will trigger what category & what color.

## Colors
Add your own colors, events using Category Styling can use user-selected colors.

Note: You can drag to reorder the colors.

Or hide the color swatches from the Add Event Modal and completely rely on the Category Styling.

## Event Behaviour
Dim or Hide events you marked as complete to declutter your calendar.

Enable "Only animate today's events" if all the animations on events feel overwhelming.

Use markdown, html & image embeds inside an event to know the event at a glance.

## Holder
Dayble Calendar has a holder on the left by default to hold events without a date in.
